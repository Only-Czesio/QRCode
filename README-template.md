## My process

I'm trying to work my system in which i'm working, so it will change throughout the experience.

First i recognize that i can create a main container which is the grey rectangle. Inside of it there is another container with a picture and text container.

After establishing the structure i started to give some styling. I set color, tried my best for centering everything, pick good margin size.

If someone will do read this, please let me know how i could do it easier. I will show You my appriciation.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've learn how to stay calm when it's about CSS and trying to make something look exactly alike. It will take time and lots of practice, but i know for sure i can master CSS.

### Continued development

I didn't manage to use exact font-family due it's external usage of different font than it's inside of a CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Channel of wholesome content](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - This man helped me a lot with understanding how to start and break a problem into smaller pieces and as well how to use flexbox.

## Acknowledgments

I will be forever thankful to my wonderful brother who is patience with me and answer to my question. He believed in me in the times i didn't believe in myself and now i can believe in myself as i saw that
programming is yet just another skill which require a lot of practice and studying but it's very rewarding and fun to do. Thank You so much.
